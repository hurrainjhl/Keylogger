# Keylogger Project Overview

The Keylogger Project is designed to monitor keyboard activity on a Windows system. It captures keystrokes, identifies the active application, and provides additional functionalities such as taking screenshots and clearing logs. This project serves as an educational tool to understand how keylogging works and the implications of such software.

## Core Functionalities

### Keystroke Logging

The primary functionality of the keylogger is to capture keystrokes in real-time. As users type, the keylogger logs each key press and release event. This includes both standard keys and special keys, enhancing the readability of the logs by translating special key actions into descriptive text. The active window title is also recorded with each keystroke, providing context about which application is being used at the time.

### Active Window Detection

To improve the utility of the logged data, the keylogger identifies and logs the title of the currently active window. This means that every keystroke is not just recorded in isolation; it is associated with the application in which it was entered. This feature is particularly useful for understanding user activity across different applications, be it web browsers, text editors, or any other software.

### Session Summarization

At the end of a logging session, the keylogger generates a summary report. This report details the frequency of each key pressed during the session. This feature allows users to quickly identify which keys are most commonly used and provides insight into user behavior during the logged period.

### Screenshot Capture

Another critical feature of the keylogger is its ability to take screenshots. When the user presses a designated key, the program captures the current screen and saves the image with a timestamp. This functionality allows for visual documentation of what the user was doing at specific moments, enhancing the context of the logged keystrokes.

### Log Management

The keylogger includes a log management feature that allows users to clear the log file at any time. This is done by pressing a specific key, which triggers the clearing of all previous entries. This feature is essential for maintaining privacy and managing log data efficiently, especially in environments where sensitive information may be entered.

### Safe Exit Mechanism

To ensure a smooth user experience, the keylogger provides a safe exit mechanism. By pressing a specific key, users can stop the logging session and take a screenshot simultaneously. This function helps users conclude their session neatly, without losing any logged data.

## Ethical Considerations

Itâ€™s important to note that while keyloggers can be used for legitimate purposes, such as monitoring for security or educational analysis, they also raise significant ethical and legal concerns. Users must ensure they have the proper consent and comply with applicable laws when utilizing such software.
